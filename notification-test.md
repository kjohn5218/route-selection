# Email Notification Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've successfully implemented the email notification functionality for the route selection system. This includes notifications for:

1. **Driver Notifications** - When a selection period opens
2. **Assignment Notifications** - After assignments are processed

## Backend Endpoints Added

### 1. Send Period Notifications
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/periods/:id/notify`
- **Purpose:** Sends notifications to all eligible drivers about an open selection period
- **Location:** `/src/routes/periods.ts:400-475`
- **Features:**
  - Validates period status (must be UPCOMING or OPEN)
  - Fetches all eligible employees with email addresses
  - Creates audit log entry
  - Returns count of notifications sent

### 2. Send Assignment Notifications  
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/assignments/notify/:periodId`
- **Purpose:** Sends assignment results to all employees after processing
- **Location:** `/src/routes/assignments.ts:483-569`
- **Features:**
  - Validates period status (must be COMPLETED)
  - Includes route details or float pool assignment
  - Creates audit log entry
  - Returns notification summary

## Frontend Updates

### Periods Component
- **Location:** `/frontend/src/pages/Periods.tsx`
- Added `notifyDriversMutation` to handle API call
- Updated notification modal to use actual API instead of alert
- Shows loading state during notification sending
- Displays success/error messages

### SelectionManagement Component
- **Location:** `/frontend/src/pages/SelectionManagement.tsx`
- Added `notifyEmployeesMutation` for assignment notifications
- Implemented CSV export functionality for results
- Fixed data structure handling for assignment results
- Updated UI to properly display processing results

## Integration Points

### Email Service Integration (TODO)
The notification endpoints are fully implemented but currently log to console. To complete the integration:

1. Choose an email service provider (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
2. Add email service credentials to environment variables
3. Replace console.log statements with actual email sending logic
4. Create email templates for notifications

Example integration code for SendGrid:
```typescript
import sgMail from '@sendgrid/mail';

sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

// In the notification endpoint:
const msg = {
  to: employee.user.email,
  from: 'noreply@routeselection.com',
  subject: `Route Selection Period Now Open: ${period.name}`,
  text: emailContent,
  html: emailHtmlContent,
};

await sgMail.send(msg);
```

## Testing

To test the notification functionality:

1. **Period Notifications:**
   - Navigate to Periods page
   - Click the send icon on an UPCOMING period
   - Review the email preview
   - Click "Send Notifications"

2. **Assignment Notifications:**
   - Process assignments for a closed period
   - After processing completes, click "Notify Employees"
   - Check console logs for notification details

## Summary

The notification system is now fully integrated into the selection period workflow:
- ✅ Email preview modals with formatted content
- ✅ API endpoints for sending notifications
- ✅ Audit logging for all notification events
- ✅ Error handling and validation
- ✅ Export functionality for assignment results
- ✅ Loading states and user feedback

The only remaining step is to integrate with an actual email service provider to send the notifications instead of logging them.
